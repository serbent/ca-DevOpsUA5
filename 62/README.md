# 62. AWS EKS. 

Create a EKS FARGATE service with all required components such as vpc, sg, public and private subnets, make it available publicly on ports 80 and 443 assume it will have traefik ingress and assign a LB for the cluster to be used by that ingress. Use aws MCP servers for assistance.
